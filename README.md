# Welcome to  kolumnin.com GitHub organization repository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an [index.html](https://kolumnin-com.github.io/kolumnin-com/) file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.
This README.md file is the default index page in the kolumnin-com repository.
